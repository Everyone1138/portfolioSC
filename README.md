# Challenge2-personal-site

## This is my portfolio website.

I appreciate any input to impove the site. I look forward to reading the feedback.

This site is a summary of skills I can show future employers what I am capable of.

As with each class I am enriched with more knowledge and I look forward to updating this site.

## All clickable links function

When the user clicks on Challenge1 it takes them to the first assignment we had to do.
The link to the JavaScript takes the user to the orange box that was required of us to make in the pre-work.
The Python3 and C# links work but the pages don't have any work in them yet.
I made it so that when you click my email it will pop-up the option of which application to use to send an email.
The LinkedIn link takes the user to my LinkedIn profile where the user can find my work history and resume.
I've also added clickable links to my GitHub and GitLab so that the user can see an uptodate list of projects I've worked on.

## HTML

I made my html code as accesible as my skills currently allow me to do. Very straight forward.

## css

I based my stlye for this off of the examples given to us with challenge 1&2. My site can adapt itself when the user changes the window size.
I used the :root to make it easier to summon the colors for the site to better have uniformity. With more practice I feel that in the future
I'll be able to consolidate some of this code but for the time being I am satisfied with the end product.

## JavaScript

JavaScript wasn't a key part of this site. But nonetheless I added what I could. In the future I plan to intigrate more JavaScript into my site
to make it more appealing the the user.
